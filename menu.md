## Menu Choices 
Menu choices are also very important when writing a program. They allow for the user to choose what they view or access, instead of being forced to follow the program exactly as its written. 
This allows for programs to be more interesting to the user, as they control what happens in the program. Menu choices could look like:

    menu_choice = input("press 1 to learn about this thing, 2 about that thing, 3 about them things,x to exit program")
        
        if menu_choice = "1"
            print("information")
            
        if menu_choice = "2"
            print("information")
            
        if menu_choice = "3"
            print("information")
            
        elif menu_choice = "x"
            break
