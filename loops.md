## Program Loops
When writing a program , it is important to have loops to allow the program to rerun, without having to completely starting over.
We achieve this by using loops.  Loops allow the program to rerun, without us having to exit and restart the program.
A loop could look like:

    run_prog = True
    
    while run_prog == True
    
        print("This would create a loop")
        Print("You would then enter your program in here")
        
        else
            break
